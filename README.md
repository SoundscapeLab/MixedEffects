This R code contains basic structures and code for the mixed-effects statistical analyses used by the Soundscape & Audiology Research Lab at UW-Madison.
Much of our work involves analyzing repeated measures data from real-world sampling methods. Mixed-effects models are generally appropriate for these types of data structures and analyses.
For statistical details, see the series of paper by Jake Oleson (Oleson et al., 2019a, 2019b, and Oleson et al. 2022). 
This code is meant as a repository for students and other scientists looking to use mixed-effects modeling. It is not exhaustive. 
Statistical approaches should always be chosen based on the research question and data structure.
